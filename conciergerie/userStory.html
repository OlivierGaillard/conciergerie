<h1>Workhour</h1>
<h2>Concierge Usage</h2>
<p>The concierge, which know almost nothing of a computer, will have to enter his working hours. So he enters the
following data:
    <ol>
    <li>date</li>
    <li>title</li>
    <li>duration in decimal format: 1.5 is 1h30min</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Admin Usage</h2>
<p>The manager diplay the list of all workhours and can filter by month, entering month and year.
    At the bottom of the list she can see the total of hours and the amount to pay. She can print this
    report.</p>

<p>She can set the amount of money per hour</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Enter hours</h2>
<p>Nothing special here.</p>
<h2>Generate salary sheet</h2>
<p>We have to filter per month and year (one field) and to generate the report by summing the durations
multiplied by the work-hour amount.</p>

<h3>Filter the hour listing</h3>

<p>We can simply use the package <em>django-filter</em>. It seems stable and up-to-date.</p>
